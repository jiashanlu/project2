# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
This webapp is a chat app where:
- a user is prompted to choose a pseudo
- create a new channel or join an existing one
- chat to the people that are in the channel

The server and client remember the 100 last message and keep it in client side if the user leave and come back.
My personal touch is
-to display personal messages on left side and messages from others on right side
-display username and date only once per batch of messages
-give an alert when a new user join the room


Note:
I have compatibility issues with IE and I have not taken the time to look at it closely
